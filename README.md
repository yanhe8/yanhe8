## Hi there 👋

I’m currently a Senior Machine Learning Scientist at Comcast within the Enterprise Business Intelligence organization, supporting Sales & Marketing. My recent focus has been leveraging AI/ML to drive customer acquisition across different sales channels.

Previously, I was on the Strategic Analytics – Finance & Growth team, where I focused on forecasting of key business metrics and applied statistical and econometric methods to evaluate offer promotions and marketing strategies, helping guide acquisition and growth decisions.

Prior to joining Comcast, I worked at Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM), where my work was mostly about policy analyses covering topics such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. I also have experience in clinical trials and experimentation from my time at Penn Medicine.

Across roles, my work consistently sits at the intersection of data science, experimentation, and business impact.
